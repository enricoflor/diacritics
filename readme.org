~diacritics~ is a tiny package for GNU Emacs that lets you insert
special characters quickly and without changing input method.  It is
inspired by the functionality that you get on MacOS when you press a
key long enough: a popup that lets you select variants of the font
(allegedly---I have never used a Mac).

With ~diacritics~, all you have to do is customize the alist
~diacritics-alist~ with the appropriate objects (formatted as
characters) to select what variants of what characters you want to
have at your disposal.  Take, for example, the default value:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar diacritics-alist '((?e . (?è ?é ?ê ?ë ?ē ?ė ?ę))
                           (?y . (?ÿ))
                           (?u . (?û ?ü ?ù ?ú ?ū))
                           (?i . (?î ?ï ?í ?ī ?į ?ì))
                           (?o . (?ô ?ö ?ò ?ó ?œ ?ø ?ō ?õ))
                           (?a . (?à ?á ?â ?ä ?æ ?ã ?å ?ā))
                           (?s . (?ß ?ś ?š))
                           (?l . (?ł))
                           (?z . (?ž ?ź ?ż))
                           (?c . (?ç ?ć ?č))
                           (?n . (?ñ ?ń))))
#+end_src

For instance, this value for ~diacritics-alist~ gives ~ñ~ and ~ń~ as
first and second variants of the base character ~n~.  You can
associate as many variants as you want to any base character (and each
variant string can in fact be multiple characters), but only the first
nine characters in any list will matter: the rest will be ignored
completely.  This is because, once you select a base character, you
will select the variant through a single digit from 1 to 9.  The
selection will be prompted in the echo area.

You can either set a different value altogether for ~diacritics-alist~
or, since it is an alist, if you want a different key map for, say,
~c~, you can cons a new cons cell that will shadow the existing one:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq diacritics-alist (cons '(?c . (?o ?h))
                             diacritics-alist))
#+end_src

All that ~diacritics~ does, technically, is adding to
~post-self-insert-hook~ the function ~diacritics--insert~, which:

+ detects that you are keeping a self insertion key pressed (instead
  of just quickly pressing it several times);
+ sets the correct transient key map according to the key you are
  pressing and the values specified in ~diacritics-alist~;
+ displays the key map in the echo area to help you select the right
  character.

The transient key map will be unset automatically as soon as you
either select one of the variants with the digit, or press any other
key (which will be inserted normally).  If you notice that the minor
mode isn't working as you'd expect you can try and tweak the value of
~diacritics--timing~.  The default is 0.05, which means that for two
key strokes to be recognized as one long key press they have to be
closer than 0.05 seconds to each other.  The value must be small
enough to make it impossible to repeat a key stroke fast enough that
it be registered by ~diacritics--insert~ as one key press.  But
depending on your system (regardless of Emacs internal) might have
different ways of registering inputs on long key presses, and that
might require this temporal value to be tweaked.

The gif illustrates how this all works (based on the default value for
~diacritics-alist~ above).
